    <string name="tutorial_welcome3">Stop invading enemies to reach the portal by improving your One Tower with items and talents!</string>
    <string name="tutorial_welcome4">Each round all enemies get stronger. In turn you have to upgrade your tower by collecting resources like Gold, DIA (diamonds) and TP (talent points) in order to buy ITEMS or learn TALENTS. </string>

    <string name="tutorial_item_found">You found an item!</string>
    <string name="tutorial_item_found_description">Killed enemies give you Gold and have a chance to drop items. Items improve your towers attributes (e.g. tower damage or speed) but cost resources (e.g. Gold or DIA). Click on an item to see its attributes and costs.  </string>
    <string name="tutorial_item_found_description2">Your tower can only use a certain amount of items at the same time. Remove unwanted items from the towers inventory by swiping UP.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_item_found_description3">To use an item simply swipe DOWN on it.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_talents1">You just received a TP!</string>
    <string name="tutorial_talents2"><u>You receive</u>\n - 1 TP (talent point) every 4 levels\n  - 1 UP (upgrade point) every 5 levels\n\n You can spend TPs in the talents menu and UPs in the items tab.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_enemies">A boss is approaching!</string>
    <string name="tutorial_enemies2">One TD has a variety of different enemy types. Some have increased armor, some are super fast. Boss type enemies will spawn every 10 waves to challenge you! They come alone but have vastly increased attributes. You can check the whole list at the wiki page: Menu -> Wiki. \n  \n  Be prepared!</string>

    <string name="tutorial_end">You completed the tutorial!</string>
    <string name="tutorial_end2">These basics will enable you to start exploring the rest of the game for yourself. \n If you have further questions you can consult the wiki. \n\nEnjoy the game and good luck! </string>
